Create in your main project your own exception class.
Think about what class you should inherit it from.
1.This exception should be raised in some specific case,
for example if you try to open a project and your
script didn't find any created projects you could raise an exception for this case.
2.After it you should add a rescue end code block
(which will catch your specific Exception class) to create a new project and then
retry to execute attempt to open a project page
3.Limit number of retries to prevent your code from endless execution
