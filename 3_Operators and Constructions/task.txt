1. Create method which gets 10 random integers (from 0 to 9) (generate it using while or until)

before output for each next number we should puts "========="
if number is even or odd it should puts string "the number is even" or "the number is odd"
if it's more (or less) than 5 it should puts appropriate string "the number is more (or less) than 5"
in case we've got "0" we should puts "we've got 0"
in each case we should get 2 messages except the '0' case

2. add to your solution next test

create project
make a random action: create or not a new bug issue
open project page,
open issues tab
if there is a bug present then add self to watchers
if no then create a new bug issue and then add self to watchers
Verify that there is a bug issue and that current user is a watcher
